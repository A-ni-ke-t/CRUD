# CRUD
This project focuses on CRUD operations with MongoDB as the database. 
Basically, it uses APIs for adding, updating, deleting, and fetching data from the database.
The APIs are as follows 
GET - http://localhost:9000/data
GET - http://localhost:9000/data/{id} 
POST - http://localhost:9000/data [ BODY REQUIRED ]
PATCH - http://localhost:9000/data/{id} [ BODY REQUIRED ]
PUT - http://localhost:9000/data/{id} [ BODY REQUIRED ]
DELETE - http://localhost:9000/data/{id}

Sample Body - {
        name: "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix",
        img: "https://bit.ly/2IcnSwz",
        summary: "Harry Potter and Dumbledore's warning"
    }
